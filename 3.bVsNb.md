BLOCKING CODE
HTTP is a synchronous protocol. 
The web browser sends a request to the server and waits for its response. 
Then it sends the next request and again waits for its response, and so on. 
Having to wait for the response before sending the next request is often a pretty huge BOTTLENECK. 





The Events Module in Node.js



Objects are emitting events...

Call back functions are listening for events emitted by the objects...



(Blocking Code can start when an event is triggered)
(The code executed can run IN PARALLEL with the rest of our code) (Asynchonicity)
(We can move on to the next item)
